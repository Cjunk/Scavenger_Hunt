## Scavenger Hunt - Stage 2A

### Create the API for adding new challenges

Add a new API endpoint which stores a new challenge in the database.

- It should be a POST request and the URL should be `/api/challenges`
- Test it using Postman

Send the POST requests using Postman but make sure you can also see the new challenges in your challenge list page.

### Already done?

You can get a headstart on the next part by also adding these API endpoints and testing them using Postman:
 - DELETE `/api/challenges/<id of challenge>` to delete a challenge
 - PUT `/api/challenges/<id of challenge>` to update a challenge
